# BDIP Development Progress Log
## Business Development Intelligence Platform - Claude Development Journal

---

## **Project Overview**
**Purpose**: Transform a UK barristers' chambers from manual enquiry tracking to an intelligent, automated business development system.

**Core Problem**: Chambers currently track enquiries in LEX (legacy system, CSV-only), losing 30% of opportunities due to poor follow-up and having no visibility into conversion rates or barrister performance.

**Solution**: Build a modern web platform that imports LEX data, adds intelligence layers, and provides real-time dashboards for clerks, barristers, and management.

## **Development Decisions Log**

### **2025-01-07 - Security Hardening**
**Decision**: Implement comprehensive security fixes before UI development
**Reasoning**: Code review identified critical CORS and transaction vulnerabilities
**Impact**: Delayed dashboard development by 1 day, but ensured production-ready security

### **2025-01-09 - Authentication Architecture**  
**Decision**: Build invitation-based signup system for chambers management
**Reasoning**: UK legal chambers need controlled access with admin oversight
**Impact**: More complex than simple signup, but fits business requirements perfectly

### **2025-01-09 - Agent Coordination Strategy**
**Decision**: Use specialized sub-agents for each domain (UI, backend, algorithms)

**Impact**: Higher coordination overhead, but better code quality and domain fit

### **2025-01-09 - Business Logic Implementation**
**Decision**: Implement all four core algorithms (engagement, routing, conversion, workload) simultaneously
**Reasoning**: Algorithms are interdependent and need consistent patterns and testing
**Impact**: Complex development phase but creates solid foundation for dashboard UIs

**Key Components Delivered:**
- **Engagement Scoring**: Multi-factor performance tracking for barristers
- **Enquiry Routing**: Intelligent assignment based on expertise and workload
